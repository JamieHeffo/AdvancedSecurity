  - `aes_encryption.py`: A Python script demonstrating AES encryption and decryption.
  - `aes_keygen.py`: Key generation and management for AES, showcasing secure key handling practices.

- **DES (Data Encryption Standard)**: An older, symmetric-key algorithm used for educational purposes.
  - `des_encryption.py`: Demonstrates DES encryption and decryption, highlighting limitations compared to AES.

- **RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)**: An asymmetric encryption method used for secure data transmission.
  - `rsa_keygen.py`: Generates public and private keys for RSA encryption.
  - `rsa_encryption.py`: Encrypts and decrypts messages using RSA, with notes on its use in secure data exchange.

### Assignment 02: Network Security and Data Integrity

- **SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm)**: A cryptographic hash function for data integrity.
  - `sha256_hash.py`: Generates SHA-256 hashes, demonstrating data integrity and verification.

- **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange**: A method for securely exchanging cryptographic keys.
  - `diffie_hellman.py`: Implementation of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol, a foundation of secure communications.
